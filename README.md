#Course: Quantitative methods in ecology and evolutionary biology

#The data I will be using throughout the semester is from the Va Appalachain Carnivore Study in the WHAPA Lab which investigated the spatial and temporal behaviors of black bear, bobcat, and coyotes through GIS collaring and remote camera trapping.
