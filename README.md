# Course: Quantitative methods in ecology and evolutionary biology

The data I will be using throughout the semester is from the Virginia Appalachian Carnivore Study in the WHAPA Lab which investigated the spatial and temporal behaviors of black bear, bobcat, and coyotes through GIS collaring and remote camera trapping. The portion of data I plan to investigate is the remote camera trapping of scavenging behaviors on dead white tailed deer carcasses. At each carrion site there were two cameras facing the carcass to capture cryptic and unknown behaviors of a multitude of different scavenging behaviors and species such as black bear, coyote, bobcat, turkey vultures, eastern cottontails, and rodents. I would like to describe the different patterns and behaviors observed like latency to detection, which species dominates the carcass after detection, and how habitat and its features affect scavenging behaviors through generalized linear modeling techniques.

- DATA:VACs_Compiled_Station_Data.csv
- Here, I explored R and some basic calculations with my VACS dataset.  

# Week 2##
- CODE:week2_david_lugo
- DATA:VACs_Compiled_Station_Data.csv
- Here, I input my data in tidy format and explored some tidyverse functions within my data. 

# Week 3##
- Code: week3_david_lugo
- DATA:VACs_Compiled_Station_Data.csv
- Here, I input my data into ggplot2 and created a boxplot graph.
